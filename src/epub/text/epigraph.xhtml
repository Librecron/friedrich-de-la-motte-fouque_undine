			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>Undine! thou fair and lovely sprite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since first from out an ancient lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw gleam forth thy fitful light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How hast thou sung my cares away!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How hast thou nestled next my heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gently offered to impart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy sorrows to my listening ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a half-shy, half-trusting child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The while my lute, in wood-notes wild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine accents echoed far and near!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then many a youth I won to muse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With love on thy mysterious ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With many a fair one to peruse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The legend of thy wondrous days.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now both dame and youth would fain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>List to my tale yet once again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, sweet Undine, be not afraid!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enter their halls with footsteps light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greet courteously each noble knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fondly every German maid.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And should they ask concerning me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, say, “He is a cavalier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who truly serves and valiantly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In tourney and festivity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lute and sword, each lady fair!”</span>
				</p>
